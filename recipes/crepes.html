        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups sifted confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream, whipped</li>
        <li>4 cups sliced strawberries</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Setps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place flour, milk, water, eggs, melted butter, and salt into a blender; blend until smooth and set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat confectioners' sugar, cream cheese, lemon juice, lemon zest, and vanilla with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Gently fold in whipped cream.</li>
